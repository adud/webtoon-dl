* datastructures
** create python datastructures for episodes, comics
** formally describe local webpages to use them to store above datastructs
** create a scraper object (I will probably soon be asked to adapt this to Tapas.io)
* caching of downloaded webpages
* update/complete comics
* refactorize generator and getter to have one cmdline (or 2 with symlinks and arg[0])?
** DWIM mode: rethink arguments to make the cmdline intuitive
   e.g: to download the whole comic, prefer `webtoon-dl <comic-url>` than `webtoon-dl -e <any-episode-url>`
